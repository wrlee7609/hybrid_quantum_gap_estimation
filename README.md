# Hybrid quantum gap estimation algorithm

This is the Qiskit code used to generate data and figures in the paper 
"A Compact Noise-Tolerant Algorithm for Unbiased Quantum Simulation Using Feynman's $i\eta$ Prescription"
by Woo-Ram Lee, Ryan Scott, and V. W. Scarola (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14039).

An interesting user can run this code on the IBMQ device with a certain choice of backends (Here we set to "ibmq_manila" by default).
An example plot was provided at the end of the code.
