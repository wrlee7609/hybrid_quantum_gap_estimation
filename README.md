# hybrid_quantum_gap_estimation

This is the Qiskit code used to generate data and figures in the paper 
"A Compact Noise-Tolerant Algorithm for Unbiased Quantum Simulation Using Feynman's $i\eta$ Prescription"
by Woo-Ram Lee, Ryan Scott, and V. W. Scarola (Unpublished).

One can run this code on the IBMQ device with a certain choice of backends (here set to "ibmq_manila" by default).
An example plot was included at the end of this code to reproduce the case of M = 16 in Fig. 2(d) of the paper.
Other plots can be reproduced with different choices of parameters.
The middle and bottom panels in Fig. 3 need another code for linear regression, which is not provided here.
